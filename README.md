# KGBCU (KGB COMIC UNIVERSE)
# Comic Generation Application - A team project by me, [jeevesh2002](https://github.com/jeevesh2002) and [bhuvnesh1871](https://github.com/bhuvnesh1871).  


## Introduction
An application designed to help users create their own comic image stories. Takes in the premise of the plot and a set of plot keywords from the user, generates a prompt for GPT-3 to write a random textual outline of the story using the given keywords, and generates comic illustrations from the text using DALL-E 2. Consists of Python back-end APIs connecting to the OpenAI APIs and a front-end website for user interaction.  




## How it Works
1. User inputs keywords related to the comic they want to generate.
2. The platform performs a quantum random walk ([Bose Hubbard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model)) on the given input.
3. A unique comic is generated and displayed to the user.
